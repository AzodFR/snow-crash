not for me...

sudo -l

user level14 may not run sudo on SnowCrash

so I can't be sudo, I can't log into flag14, all I can do is 
to bruteforce the getflag binary

gdb /bin/getflag

r
|
L-> You should not reverse this

the binary know that we are in a debugger ?

strings /bin/getflag
|
L-> getuid
L-> ptrace

The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process may observe and control the execution of another process

ok so the ptrace know that we are in a debugger, we may breakpoint on it 
we will also break on getuid to spoof our uid

I su flag00 and flag01 to check their uid and its 3000 and 3001 so 
the fake uid will be 3014

gdb /bin/getflag

break ptrace

break getuid

r

the program launch and break at the start of ptrace lets check the eax value

print $eax
|
L-> $1 = 0

ok so it's not even launched

s

print $eax
|
L-> $2 = -1

ok so that is where the error is from
let's spoof the debugger

set $eax = 1

s

here we go we are on the second breakpoint
let's re-check the eax value (it will store our uid)

print $eax
|
L-> $3 = 32

s

print $eax
|
L-> $4 = 2014

ther is our uid, let's spoof it

set $eax = 3014

s

here we go, we have the flag
