L-> UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

ok so we see that the program check our UID let's see how he get it

strings level13
|
L-> getuid

ok so it call the getuid program an may compare it with 4242 let's launch it with a debugger

gdb level13

to see whats the program do let's dissassemble the main

disass main
|
L->  0x08048595 <+9>:     call   0x8048380 <getuid@plt>
L->  0x0804859a <+14>:    cmp    $0x1092,%eax

there is the first call of getuid, it store the result in eax then compare it, if we check in hex to dec, 1092 = 4242
so we need toput a breakpoint on the cmp adress to change the eax value to 4242

break *0x0804859a

r

print $eax
|
L-> $1 = 2013

so there is our uid but we need to set it to 4242 

set $eax = 4242
